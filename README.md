# WHAT IS THIS!????
Have you ever wanted some more Ooble goodness in your life? Well here's your chance, with the Ooble Resource Pack for Minecraft: Java Editions. A vanilla+ pack, this replaces certain aspects of your minecraft world to bring it ever closer to Ooble perfection
# How can I contribute?
The minecraft wiki has a helpful [https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Creating_a_resource_pack](article) that details how to create a pack. The main way you can contribute to the Great Journeyâ„¢ is by creating pixel art that can then be implemented into the package. The main requirement for them is that they have the exact file name as the item you want to replace, and that they're placed in the corresponding file directory as the vanilla asset.
# Download
You can download the latest version of the resource pack using [https://download-directory.github.io/?url=https://github.com/JoshTheHumanBean/OobleResourcePack/tree/main/Ooble%20Resource%20Pack](this) link.
